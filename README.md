#Safety Screamer ðŸš—ðŸ“¢

Keep your hands on the wheel, not your phone.

Safety Screamer is a mobile app designed to promote safer driving habits by helping drivers stay focused on the road. The app detects when a driver navigates away from it during a drive and plays "guilty messages" to remind them to prioritize safety and avoid distractions.

Features:
Start Your Drive: Activate the app when you begin driving to stay focused.
Stay Accountable: Detects when you switch away from the app to use your phone.
Guilty Messages: Plays audio messages to encourage drivers to return their attention to the road.
Safety Screamer aims to reduce distracted driving and make roads safer for everyone. ðŸš¦
